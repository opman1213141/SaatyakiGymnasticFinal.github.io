<h2>Code of Points (CoP)</h2>
<p>The official rule book by which judges evaluate routines in major international competitions. Issued by world governing body, the FIG, the guide is updated each quarter, culminating in an Olympic Games, to revise rules, regulations, and skills. Separate CoP are issued for men and women. Gymnasts and coaches scour the document each cycle to maximise start value. See also, wolf turn.</p>

<h2>Connection value</h2>
<p>Combine difficult elements together and the gymnast can receive bonus points. The skills must be performed without pause or interruption so look out for dubious connection attempts.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Deductions</h2>
<p>Points are taken off a gymnast's score for errors. A fall from the apparatus is the big one, with a whole mark being deducted.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2>D-score (difficulty)</h2>
<p>There are two components of a gymnast’s final score – the D-score and the E-score (execution). The D-Score evaluates the difficulty level of the skills performed. Two panels of judges – the D-score judges and the E-score judges – mark each routine and the scores are then added together. The difficulty score is open-ended with no maximum value – but typically ranges from 5 to 7 at the Olympic level – while the E-score is out of a maximum of ten points. Vault is the only apparatus that has the same set D-score.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2>E-score (execution)</h2>
<p>There are two components of a gymnast’s final score – the E-score and the D-score (difficulty). The E-score evaluates the performance of a routine, with bent knees, poor toe point or a stumble on landing all examples of poor execution. The E-score starts at 10, and judges deduct marks based on execution errors. Two panels of judges score each routine, and the final score is the combined total of the E- and D-scores.</p>
