<li><h2>Shannon Miller</h2>
<p>Shannon is a popular gymnast from the United States whose achievements continue even today to inspire others. Her specialty is her ability to excel at the international level when it was too competitive to win in an all-around competition. Per nation, only three contenders were allowed to participate all-around finals. Her accomplishments started with the most esteemed all-around silver in the world-famous Olympics of 1992 and continued in 1993 and 1994 with revered titles. Notably, Shannon was yet a medal challenger in the until 1996. Post a few errors although she had completed eighth, she grabbed the beam title in the 1996’s Olympics and gained a gold medal for the U.S. team in the same year. Overall, this courageous lady won two revered titles, respectively and four national titles in distinct competitions. Her eminence over a period of several years perhaps makes her the best American gymnast.</p>

<h2>Simone Biles</h2>
<p>With an accomplishment of 19 titles including both of the Olympics and world championship events, Simone is perhaps the most garlanded American gymnast. Interestingly, she had grabbed this title from the best American gymnast, Shannon Miller. As a senior, Simone has proved herself to be the most brilliant and leading gymnasts the nation has ever seen. She has won three world championship and three world floor championship titles along with two world balance beam titles. In the Olympics of 2016 held in Brazil’s Rio, this festooned gymnast grabbed a gold. She also was in the gold medalist team, which was popularly recognized as the Final Five. Currently, her records accredit her for earning the most golds in the single Olympics’ field of gymnastics. Simone has even got the top honor of being an all-around American champion in national events. Well, reverently, she has managed to get this honor for not only one time but four times. One more notable victory in her name is the defeat of Shannon and Nastia in championship events at the international level.</p>

<h2>Nastia Liukin</h2>
<p>Nastia is also a great inspirer for other women to shape their career in gymnastics after pushing herself in the list of top U.S. gymnasts of all time. What made her reach this level distinctively was her achievement of all-round gold in the Olympics, which was what Shannon could not achieve. Even today, she does not have this one accomplishment. Nastia has won five total medals in just a single Olympics held at Beijing namely, silver in bars and beam, team; all-around gold; and bronze on a floor. Those who know Nastia will agree that she had an extraordinarily celebrated career. At nine, Nastia was neck to neck with Shannon in terms of world medals. Right from 2003 to 2008, she grabbed all national title on bars along with several all-around, floor, and balance beam accomplishments. However, it is fact that Shannon yet leads by grabbing medals while competing in two Olympics and accomplishing the world all-around title two times.</p>
